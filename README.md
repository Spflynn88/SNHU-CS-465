Functionality:
Unlike JavaScript, JSON is not a full programming language. It is a way to structure data that makes it easy to parse and type, making it very useful for entering data into a database.

One way that we refactored code was the addition of Handlebars. This allowed us to take individual page elements and use them in multiple places without needing to write duplicate code. This makes projects cleaner, easier to read, easier to debug, and easier to scale.

Testing:
Methods in this context are what the API uses to make requests such as GET, PUT and POST. These are all various ways in which the API interacts with the data and the server.

Endpoints are individual URLs of the website, each containing data relevant to that page. This is how the API manages which page is holding what information.

Whenever a website is being built it is important to keep security in mind. In our site we put in user authentication using JSON Web token to keep track of users but when building a site for release there are many more steps that would need to be taken. Some of these are authorization, data validation and encryption.

Reflection:
Although I have no interest in working with the web after graduation, it was enlightening to see the process of building a complete website. I was a little rushed this semester and look forward to reviewing the guide again in the future when I have more time to experiment. I have used JSON frequently in personal projects to store things like NPC stats and equipment stats (in terms of making a game), and I also looked a JavaScript a bit in the past. However seeing all the elements come together and work was interesting to do hands on.
